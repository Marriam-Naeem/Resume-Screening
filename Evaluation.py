    ["Here is the Resume that Best Matches the Job Description that you have provided: Candidate's Name: (Unavailable in dataset; associated with index 2) Index of the Resume: 2 Experience, Education, Skills, and Relevant Information: Experience: Information Technology Manager with professional accomplishments in managing IT teams and strategic projects.
